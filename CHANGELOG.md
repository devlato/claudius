## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- studio: Download the sample packs from the studio ([#17](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/17))
- macos: claudius.app in a disk image, one app for Apple silicon and Intel Macs ([#13](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/13))
- windows: An installer, with the studio in the Start menu ([#14](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/14))
- linux: .deb, .rpm and AppImage packages, with the studio in the app menu ([#15](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/15))

### Changed

- critic: Read realness over eight windows, and encode the MP3 while the critic listens ([#18](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/18))

### Fixed

- packs: Setup installs a pack whose WAV files have a long fmt chunk, and gets the ears when a pack fails ([#19](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/19))
- mcp: Wait for the ears to load before exiting, instead of crashing ([#20](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/20))
- remake: Play a remake at a tempo its genre plays ([#21](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/21))
- What a newcomer misread: download sizes, save messages, ears loading, MCP schemas ([#22](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/22))
- critic: Advice a person can act on, instead of z-scores and near ties ([#23](https://github.com/devlato/claudius/pull/23))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-18

The first public release.

### Added

- A beatmaker that composes, arranges, mixes and masters songs in eight genres (house, deep house, techno, trap,
  lofi, drum and bass, synthwave, future bass), using real audio only: synthesized drums and synths, 162 sampled
  instruments from 14 freely licensed sample packs, Apple Loops when GarageBand is installed, and your own files.
- A critic that judges every render: loudness and tonal balance, the energy arc of the arrangement, music theory
  checks, and earshot's CLAP model for genre fit and production quality. Every issue names what to change.
- Mutation and evolution: songs change the way a producer would change them, and the critic keeps the better ones.
- A script language: Rhai with Strudel-style mini-notation patterns. Every song prints as a script that runs back
  into the same song.
- The studio, a native and web app (egui) with arrangement, step sequencer, mixer, harmony, script and verdict
  panels.
- MCP tools, over stdio and HTTP, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex and other assistants can make and edit songs
  while you listen, and skills that teach them the craft: making and editing songs, remixing recordings, and setting
  claudius up. `claudius connect` installs both.
- Analysis and remakes of any song: tempo, key, chords, sections and groove, rebuilt in any genre.
- `claudius setup`, `doctor` and `connect` for installing the sounds and models, checking an installation, and
  configuring assistants.
- Builds for macOS on Apple silicon and Intel (Intel Macs have no ears: their verdicts come from the meters and the
  theory checks), Linux on x86_64 and ARM64 with a headless build for machines without sound or a display, and
  Windows as a preview. One-line installers for each, which come with every release and are in its checksums.
